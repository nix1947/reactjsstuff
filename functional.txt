Concepts of functional programming comes from lambda-calculus.

In the late 1950s, John McCarthy took the concepts derived from Î»-calculus and applied them to a
new programming language called Lisp. Lisp implemented the concept of higher-order functions and
functions as first-class members or first-class citizens. A function is considered a first-class member
when it can be declared as a variable and sent to functions as an argument. These functions can even
be returned from functions.


Higher order functions
======================
function that take function or return function are calle HOF.
